# Release procedure

Build and check a fresh, allowlisted release package:

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/check_public_tree.py --require-private-markers
python3 tools/scripts/check_release_metadata.py
python3 tools/scripts/build_package.py
python3 tools/scripts/build_package.py --check
python3 tools/scripts/validate_skills.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/tests/static -v
python3 tools/scripts/export_release.py
```

`check_public_tree.py` scans every file git would track, case-insensitively for
private markers and separately for credential patterns. It rejects symlinks,
unreadable and binary files. Only exact reviewed example lines have private-marker
exceptions; credentials are never exempt. Findings withhold the matched value.

Local private markers come from the ignored `.private-markers` file; CI reads
the repository Actions secret `ROOTLY_SKILLS_PRIVATE_MARKERS`, using the same
one-regex-per-line format. The release check and CI fail if neither is configured.
A maintainer must provision that secret without committing or printing its value.
Fork pull requests do not receive repository secrets: their private-marker check
will remain blocked until a trusted maintainer performs the equivalent review.
Do not use `pull_request_target` to expose the secret to untrusted code.
Run the local scan before staging or pushing. CI detects uploaded content; it
cannot undo disclosure after a push to a public repository.

The exporter writes a content-addressed directory and deterministic ZIP under
`dist/`. It includes only enumerated runtime and docs files, `skills/`, and
`adapters/`. It rejects symlinks, unexpected file types, private markers and
obvious credential patterns. These checks supplement human review; they are not
a universal secret detector. `release-inventory.json` gives per-file hashes.

Validate and install from the exported directory, not the source checkout.
Keep test traces under the ignored `tools/tests/results/`; they can contain live
Rootly records and never belong in the repository or a release. Inspect the
final ZIP before sharing it.

Creating a local artifact does not publish it. A release is a tagged commit
plus the exported ZIP, after the static suite, current judge calibration, complete
evidence-fidelity matrix and manual semantic review in `tools/tests/README.md` pass.
An export is only a candidate; old matrix results do not clear changed skills.

## Versioning

`VERSION` is the only place a version is typed, and only through
`tools/scripts/bump_version.py`. Everything else derives from it: the generated
manifests through `build_package.py`, the exported artifact
name, the top `CHANGELOG.md` section, the README status line and the migration
title. `check_release_metadata.py` fails when any of these disagree; CI runs it
on every push and again before a release.

Versions are `MAJOR.MINOR`: `1.0`, `1.1`, `1.2`, then `2.0`. No patch digit,
no pre-release suffix.

- **Minor**: the normal release. New skills, references, routes or adapters,
  and fixes to wording, evidence rules or examples. Existing prompts keep working.
- **Major**: a skill is removed or renamed, an output contract changes shape, or
  a workflow gains write actions. Users must re-read the migration notes.

The release tag is `v` plus the exact `VERSION`, on the commit whose changelog
section carries the release date. One tag per version; a tag is never moved.

### Commit messages

Every commit follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`type(scope): summary`, lowercase, imperative, no trailing period, 72 characters
at most. Types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`,
`ci`, `chore` and `revert`; the scope is optional and usually a skill name, such
as `fix(on-call): keep coverage gaps visible`. A `!` after the type or scope
marks a breaking change, which means a major version. CI checks every pushed
commit with `tools/scripts/check_commit_messages.py`.

The changelog stays the curated release notes; commit subjects are for the
history and the compare link in each release.

### Bump

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/bump_version.py 1.1
```

This rewrites `VERSION`, retitles the unreleased changelog section (or opens a
new one when the top section is already dated), updates the README status line
and the migration title, regenerates the manifests and runs the metadata check.
It refuses a malformed version or one that does not follow the current one;
`--allow-downgrade` overrides the ordering check and is only legitimate before
the first release tag exists.
Fill in the changelog entries; the bump is committed together with the release below.

### Release

```sh
python3 tools/scripts/bump_version.py --release   # dates the top changelog section
# run the release checks above
git commit -am "chore(release): v1.1"
git tag -a v1.1 -m v1.1
git push origin main v1.1
```

A release is exactly one commit, `chore(release): v<VERSION>`, holding the
version bump, the dated changelog and the regenerated manifests, with the tag on
that commit. The release workflow refuses a tag on any other commit.

Pushing the tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It repeats the static
gates, refuses a tag that does not equal `v$VERSION` or a changelog section
still marked unreleased, exports the package and creates a GitHub Release titled
after the tag with three assets: `rootly-v<VERSION>.zip`, its `.sha256`, and
`release-inventory.json`. `tools/scripts/release_notes.py` writes the notes: the
changelog section, which skills changed since the previous tag with a compare
link, the install commands and the archive checksum. The workflow never creates tags,
runs models or publishes to a marketplace; the submissions below are made by
hand and point at the released ZIP.

## Where each listing is submitted

The GitHub repository must be public first; every listing below points at it
or at the exported ZIP. Verified against each platform's docs on 2026-10-16.

| Target | Submission | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code, claude.ai, Cowork | Developer portal at https://claude.ai/directory/manage | Requires a paid claude.ai plan (Team/Enterprise: an Owner). Run `claude plugin validate <export> --strict` first. The `claude-plugins-official` marketplace is partner-only. |
| Codex and ChatGPT | Plugins dashboard at https://platform.openai.com/plugins → Upload new or existing plugin | Upload the `dist/` ZIP. One shared directory serves both clients; Metadata & Skills scans must pass before Submit for review. |
| Cursor | https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish | Manual review; public repo and README required. |
| Devin | No self-serve form | The public marketplace is curated by Cognition; ask via https://app.devin.ai/settings/support or support@cognition.ai. Users can install from the repo directly with `devin plugins install Rootly-AI-Labs/agent-skills`. |
| skills.sh | None | Listing appears automatically after the first `npx skills add Rootly-AI-Labs/agent-skills` against the public repo. Only then does the `https://skills.sh/b/Rootly-AI-Labs/agent-skills` badge resolve; add it to the README after that, not before. |
