# Rootly tool mapping

These are read operations verified against the public Rootly MCP source at
`427bd6128704eb663eb394fc614858dba15d0d5e` (2026-10-07), reviewed 2026-10-09.
This is source verification, not a capture of your connected server's tool list.
Discover the current schema and read-only annotations before calling a tool.
If a capability is absent, say so; do not guess aliases or bypass its permissions.

Generated OpenAPI tools can expose different parameter spelling from the HTTP
API. Copy the MCP schema's spelling; do not send bracketed HTTP filters unless
that schema accepts them. Stop on a real auth failure rather than retrying with
broader credentials. Scope and page list operations before expanding them.

| Need | Tool | Access | Inputs and constraints |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resolve services | `list_services` | read | Use supported filter and pagination arguments |
| Owner record | `get_team` | read | Use exact team ID argument from the connected schema |
| Incident context/history | `list_incidents` | read | service_ids, status, page_size, page_number; started_after/started_before for scoped historical trends |
| Current on-call | `get_oncall_handoff_summary` | read | team_ids or schedule_ids, timezone; do not treat a listed responder as verified available |

Metrics/logs, CI/review/deploy evidence, calendars, and policy are separate
sources. Use them only if connected and authorized; Rootly records are not
substitutes for unavailable telemetry or a missing deployment feed.
