# Project instructions

## Skills

Keep canonical skills in `skills/`. Platform adapters stay thin and never copy
skill instructions. Treat practitioner recommendations as conditional guidance,
distinguish customer policy from defaults, and preserve the read-only scope of
the 1.x releases.

## Evidence

Skills must not present inference as fact. Run the static suite and, for output
changes, the evidence-fidelity gate described in `tools/tests/README.md`.

## What stays out of this repository

This repository is public. Do not add planning documents, telemetry, interview
material, personal attribution, credentials, or raw test traces. Test traces
belong in the ignored `tools/tests/results/`. `tools/scripts/check_public_tree.py` runs in
CI and fails on known private markers.


## Commits

Use Conventional Commits, `type(scope): summary`, as described in
`docs/releasing.md`. Release commits are exactly `chore(release): v<VERSION>`.
Check a message before committing with `python3 tools/scripts/check_commit_messages.py`.

## Pinned files

`tools/tests/behavior/fidelity/judge-agreement.json` records hashes of
`tools/scripts/fidelity_judge.py`, `fidelity_contract.py`, `fidelity_gate.py`
and the fidelity rubric, labels and fixtures. Any edit, even a comment, makes the
judge calibration stale and requires a new model run. Those two scripts resolve
their paths from `tools/`, not the repository root; leave that as is.
