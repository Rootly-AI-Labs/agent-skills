# Changelog

## 1.0 — 2026-10-16

- Seven read-only skills for incident work: incident response, alert triage,
  deploy checks, service health, on-call, incident communications, and
  retrospectives.
- One plugin for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Devin, with Rootly's hosted MCP
  server bundled. Sign in once with OAuth; there are no API keys to manage.
- Slash-command aliases such as `/rootly:respond`, `/rootly:oncall`, and
  `/rootly:retro` in Claude Code and Cursor.
- Read-only tool allowlists for Claude Code and Codex, so an agent in a shared
  session cannot page, edit, or publish.
- Answers separate what Rootly records show from inference and leave
  operational decisions to people.

This release replaces the earlier Rootly plugins for Claude Code and Cursor. It
does not include their write actions yet; read `docs/migration.md` before
switching.
